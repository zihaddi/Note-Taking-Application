Technical Interview Task: Secure
Note-Taking Application

1. Application Overview
Build a simple REST API accompanied by a functional frontend. The visual style of the frontend
is not a priority; the focus should be on functionality and integration.
Core Objective: Create a note-taking platform with secure authentication and role-based access
control.

2. Roles & Permissions
Implement the following roles with specific access rights:
● User:
○ Can create, update, delete, and view a list of their own notes.
● Admin:
○ Inherits all User capabilities.
○ Can manage users (add, remove, update, and list all users).
○ Can view everyone's notes.

3. Technical Stack Requirements
You are required to use the following technologies and standards:
● Database: MongoDB with Mongoose.
● Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
● Security: Implement secure password hashing.

4. Database Indexing & API Optimization
Note: You must use the schema.index method for defining indexes in your code so they are
visible during review.

A. General Optimization
● Pagination: Implement pagination for all list operations in the REST API.
● List Operation Indexing: Create proper indexes to support all list views (e.g., a user
listing their notes, an admin listing users).
● Read Operation Indexing: Ensure all GET operations (e.g., fetching a user profile or a
specific note) are supported by indexes.
B. Aggregation Tasks
You must solve the following specific scenarios using MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines. Ensure
all pipeline queries are supported by appropriate indexes.
● Scenario 1: Group by Interests
○ Context: User profiles contain a list of interests (e.g., ['chess',
'reading']).
○ Task: specific view to see users grouped by interests.
○ Constraint: You must use exactly one collection.aggregate() call. Do not
use any other methods.
● Scenario 2: User Posts ($lookup)
○ Context: Users can write posts which are stored in a separate Posts collection.
These posts are visible to everyone.
○ Task: Retrieve all posts belonging to a particular user.
○ Constraint: Use a single aggregation pipeline with a $lookup stage.

5. Critical Constraint
DO NOT MAKE ANY UNNECESSARY INDEXES. You will be evaluated on the
efficiency of your indexing strategy. Only create indexes that are strictly required to
support the queries and aggregations described above.
